    "### 3.0 – Bayesian Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an insurance company trying to determine the risk of 1) *an accident* and 2) *theft* of a car. The company has access to information based on input variables provided by the customer, such as whether the driver is young, has been driving for a long time and if they have a garage. All variables have been binarized for simplicity, so there is no scale of membership – the customer is either young (1) or not (0). \n",
    "\n",
    "The company has built a **Bayesian network** to model the relationships between these variables and the risk of an accident or theft. Most input variables don't have a *direct* influence on the risk, but affect it *indirectly* through **hidden variables** that must be estimated. The risk is represented by the output variables `Accident` and `Theft`. The Bayesian network is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![bnet](bnet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the known input variables (`Young`, `HighIncome`, `ExperiencedDriver`, `HistoryOfAccidents`, `ModernCar`, `Garage`) are represented by green nodes, the hidden variables (`RiskAverse`, `SkilledDriver`, `SafetyFeatures`, `Tempting`, `Antitheft`) by yellow nodes and the output variables (`Accident`, `Theft`) by red nodes. The arrows represent the dependencies between the variables, such that an arrow from node A to node B indicates that A has a direct influence on B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we only have direct access to the input variables, we need to estimate their effect on the unknown variables. In practice, this is usually done empirically by using data from the past, allowing us to make statements like \"young drivers tend to be bigger risk-takers\" or \"modern cars tend to have better safety features but are also more tempting for thieves\". These observations are summarized in the following **conditional probability tables** (CPTs):\n",

    "The Bayesian Network successfully captures several important causal relationships, which seems to match with intuitions (and of course the given real data). However, Many important factors are reduced to yes/no: “Skilled driver” vs levels of skill, “Modern car” vs model year or safety rating, “Accident” without severity etc. This limits expressiveness and can hide important nonlinear effects.\n",

    "- Driving frequency and exposure\n",

    "- Driver fatigue, distraction, or intoxication\n",
    "- Neighborhood crime rate (for theft)"
