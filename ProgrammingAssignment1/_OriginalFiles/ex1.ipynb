    "There are some concepts you should be familiar with before going ahead with the assignments for this course. There are no tasks in this first section – all the code is provided for you to read and understand. If you're already familiar with Python classes as well as the stack and queue data structures, you can skim through this section. If not, please read the following explanations carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an **object-oriented** programming language and as such allows you to define your own **classes**, which can be utilized for implementing abstract data types. A class is defined using the `class` keyword, followed by the name of the class (typically in CapWords) and a colon. A class can contain **attributes** (member variables) and **methods** (member functions) that define its behavior. In this course, we define all member variables in the `__init__` method and initialize them as `None` if needed, as Python does not support uninitialized variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **stack** is a data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. It can be visualized as a vertical stack of books, where you can only add or remove books from the top of the stack. A stack is defined by three operations: 1) `read`: you may read the *last* element of the stack, 2) `push`: you may insert data at the *end* of the stack and 3) `pop`: you may delete (and read) data from the *end* of the stack. No other operations for manipulating data are permitted.\n",

    "A stack can be implemented in the following way using a class and a list:"

    "* The `__init__` method is a **constructor** that is automatically called when an object of the class is created. It initializes the attributes of the class. Here, it initializes an empty list to represent an empty stack.\n",
    "* The underscore before the attribute name `_data` is a convention used in Python to indicate that it is a protected attribute, meaning it should not be accessed directly from outside the class. Instead, you should use the provided methods to interact with the stack. This corresponds with using the `protected` keyword in other programming languages like Java or C++. Double underscores (e.g., `__data`) would indicate a private attribute, but this is not so common in Python.\n",
    "* Each method in the class has a `self` parameter, which refers to the instance of the class. This allows you to access the attributes and methods of the class. Attributes and methods of the class *inside* the class are accessed using the `self` keyword, while attributes and methods of the class *outside* the class are accessed using the instance name.\n",
    "* For simplicity, the `pop` method is designed to also return the last element of the stack, making `read` only necessary for debugging purposes.\n",

    "Imagine a third-person video game where you control a character that can move freely in a 3D world. The same is true for other characters in the game, which are controlled by the computer. Let's say one of these computer-controlled characters is trying to reach the player, but the way is not clear as there are obstacles in the way. How would movement and path-finding in the game be implemented?\n",
    "\n",
    "An important point is that a virtual 3D world does not require omni-directional movement or a continuous space. Assuming a sufficiently flat environment, the space of allowed locations can be represented as a discrete 2D **grid**. This grid can in turn be interpreted as a **graph** where each cell in the grid is a **node** and the edges are the connections between adjacent nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to apply a search algorithm to this problem, we need to define the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Search space**: the set of all possible states that can be reached from the initial state. In our case, this is the set of all nodes in the grid.\n",
    "* **Initial state**: the state from which the search starts.\n",
    "* **Goal state**: the state that we want to reach.\n",
    "* **Actions**: the set of all possible actions that can be taken from a given state. In our case, this is the set of all possible moves that can be made from a given square (up, down, left, right).\n",
    "* **Action cost**: each action has a cost associated with it, which is the cost of moving from one node to another. In this problem we are working with an unweighted grid, so the cost of each action is the same.\n",
    "* **Transition model**: a function that takes a state and an action and returns the resulting state. In our case, since there is no uncertainty associated with the actions, the transition model is simply the action itself (i.e., moving to an adjacent node).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to do is to define appropriate data structures for the problem. We've already defined the `Stack` and `Queue` classes above, but we still need a way to represent the grid and the nodes in it. We can define the grid as a list of lists, where each element is a `Node` object. You may take a look at the `ex1_utils.py` file to see how the grid is constructed and populated with nodes, but this is not strictly necessary."
